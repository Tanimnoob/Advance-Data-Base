An online retail management system is a platform that combines several modules
to aid in the day-to-day operation of a retail store or chain, such as managing and
buying inventory, checking out customers, scheduling employee shifts, keeping
track of finances, etc. We include three types of user such as Admin, Manager and
Cashier. They have to login in this system. Admin can manage other employee
details. Manager can manage inventory. If he wants he would be able to sell
products. He also purchases product from suppliers whenever he needs. Here, also
customer and supplier information are stored but they are not directly user in our
system. It makes easier to both suppliers and consumers to sell and get products
form one place. It can be a best solution to suppliers to sell products from one
place. From this website, managing products and checking product stock reports
and product related informationâ€™s is easier. It makes shopping a pleasurable
experience and ensures the customers leave the store with a smile. This project will
become a hub for small retailers to sell daily necessary products from one place
and will help consumers to get whatever they need.
